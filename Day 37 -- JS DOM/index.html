    <!-- DOM stands on Document Object Model -->

    <!-- With the HTML DOM(Document Object Model), JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document. -->

    <!-- When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page. The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects -->

    <!-- With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

    JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
    JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
    JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
    JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
    JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
    JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
    JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page -->


    <script>
        document.title = "harry is good"
        // document.title = "harry is good" -->> using this we can dynamically change the title of the page , now the page title is "harry is good"

        console.log(document.title)
        console.log(document.body)
        document.body.style.backgroundColor = "green"
        // document.body.style.backgroundColor = "green" -->> we can directly access the html files elements and change the styles ,, for that we just need to do 

        // (style.backgroundColor = "green") -->> we have to use style. then whatever style we want to perform equals to inside the inverted comma write the styles

        // document.body.style.backgroundColor = "green" -->> this is treat as a inline css which precedence is higher and it can overwrite the internal and external css
